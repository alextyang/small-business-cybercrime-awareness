          <h1>Phishing Mail</h1>
          <p>A form of social engineering attack where an attacker poses as a trusted service to collect information such as bank account credentials, login information, or can install malware. The results of phishing attacks is the commonly known ransomware or denial of service (DoS) attack where access is revoked until the user provides information or pays a specified amount of money.</p>

          <h1>Vendor Vulnerability</h1>
          <p>A commonly used website-creation service, Wix, had a flaw in their systems discovered in 2016. The bug allowed attackers to run a script giving administrator-level access to the site. Any time a service receives access to consumer data it creates a new level of vulnerability for the company and therefore should be used with discretion.</p>

          <h1>Compromised Credentials</h1>
          <p>A data breach due to compromised credentials occurs when an employee login is compromised, allowing an unauthorized user to access a database they should not be able to access. This is often due to storing passwords or other login information in a compromised location and is difficult to detect as the system will not detect anything wrong. However, this is also easily addressable through proper employee training and encouraging cyber-safe practices in and out of the workplace.</p>

        <div class="crimeDesc">
          <h1>Cloud Misconfiguration</h1>
          <p>A cloud misconfiguration occurs when a system, tool, or asset has not been secured properly and leads to data being exposed. This can mean that access to certain resources is unrestricted or simply not provisioned correctly. Even the most secure systems can be vulnerable to a chink in the armor and this is the case. While more common in small businesses without the ability to carry out penetration testing or “pen tests”, this type of data breach should be a concern for large corporations who have otherwise secure data practices. </p>
